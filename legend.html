                Pressing X on your keyboard makes Gogu the reindeer run away
              </li>
              <li>
                You can move the reindeer's position, but Gogu drank too much
                and he is very confused, so he doesn't know how to go step by
                step. It's all or nothing for Gogu. This is why he lost all his
                money gambling. Anyway, you press WASD to "control" Gogu (Gogu
                is out of control, to be honest). Refresh the page in case of
                emergency
